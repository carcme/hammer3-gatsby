    text: "Patient education is a fundamental aspect of a dental hygienist’s job. By teaching their patients how to best care for their mouth, they are effectively serving as public health ambassadors. Dental hygienists instruct patients of all ages on how to properly brush and floss their teeth, and also stress the importance of doing so. They may discuss the link between diet and oral health and make recommendations to help patients select toothbrushes and other oral care devices",

    heading:"Applying Preventive Care",
    text: "After performing the cleaning, hygienists take a more proactive approach by educating the patient in preventive oral care. Precautionary treatments like fluoride and sealant application play an important role in promoting dental health between appointments. Fluoride treatments are important because fluoride strengthens teeth and fortifies them against acid erosion. Fluoride not only helps prevent tooth decay, but it can also reverse early decay. Sealants are helpful, particularly for children, in controlling decay in certain areas of the mouth. A dental sealant is an acrylic-like material that helps protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth",
